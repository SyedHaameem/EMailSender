Small idea of sending Emails Using Python,
🙌collage days #intial days of pyhton
<h1> Hi EveryOne, <h2>
<br>
<h3> This email sender project uses Python modules like email.message, ssl, and smtplib to send secure emails.,</h3>
  
<H3> It initializes an EmailMessage object to define the sender, recipient, subject, and body of the email.</H3>
<h2>A secure connection is established using ssl.create_default_context() and Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) on port 465.</h2> 

<p>The sender logs in with credentials and sends the email using smtplib.SMTP_SSL. Improvements include correcting the SMTP server address, securing credentials with environment variables, adding error handling for connection or authentication issues, and validating email addresses. This simple script automates email sending efficiently but requires careful security considerations. </p>

<h2>Thanks For your Time🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗</h2>
